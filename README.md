<h1>MicroJava Compiler - README</h1>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
This project is a MicroJava compiler designed to translate MicroJava programs into MicroJava bytecode that can be executed on the MicroJava virtual machine. The compiler consists of four main components: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation.

<h4>Functionality</h4>
<h5>Lexical Analysis:</h5> The lexical analyzer (scanner) reads the source code and identifies the language's lexemes, returning a set of tokens. It uses a .flex specification file transformed into a Java lexer class using the JFlex tool. The lexer recognizes identifiers, constants, keywords, operators, and comments. It also handles whitespace and skips comments.

<h5>Syntax Analysis:</h5> The syntax analyzer ensures that the extracted tokens form grammatically correct sentences. It uses the CUP interface to communicate with the lexical analyzer. If the source code contains syntax errors, appropriate error messages are displayed, and parsing continues after error recovery.

<h5>Semantic Analysis:</h5> The semantic analyzer processes the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated during syntax analysis. It visits the nodes of the AST and performs semantic checks. If semantic errors are detected in the source code, appropriate error messages are displayed.

<h5>Code Generation:</h5> The code generator translates syntactically and semantically correct programs into executable MicroJava bytecode for the MicroJava virtual machine. It generates code by visiting the nodes of the AST and producing bytecode instructions.

<h4>Requirements</h4>
The project requires a lexical analyzer implemented using a .flex specification file transformed into a Java lexer class using the JFlex tool.
The lexical analyzer should recognize identifiers, constants, keywords, operators, and comments according to the MicroJava language specification.
The lexical analyzer should skip whitespace and comments.
The syntax analyzer should use the CUP interface and handle syntax errors, providing appropriate error messages.
The semantic analyzer should process the AST and perform semantic checks, displaying error messages for any detected semantic errors.
The code generator should translate the syntactically and semantically correct programs into executable MicroJava bytecode.
<h3>Usage</h3>
To use the MicroJava compiler, follow these steps:

Compile the project's source code using JDK 1.8.
Run the compiler, specifying the MicroJava source file as input.
The compiler will perform lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation.
If no errors are detected, the compiler will produce the corresponding MicroJava bytecode.
Execute the generated bytecode on the MicroJava virtual machine.
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
The MicroJava compiler project provides a complete solution for translating MicroJava programs into MicroJava bytecode. By implementing the lexical analyzer, syntax analyzer, semantic analyzer, and code generator, it allows for the compilation and execution of MicroJava programs. This project demonstrates the process of transforming high-level programming language code into a form suitable for execution on a specific virtual machine.
